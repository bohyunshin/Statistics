## Spatial Statistics: Large Data



### For Geostatistical data

* Projection based MCMC, Gaun et Hara, 2018 (possible on SGLMMs)
  * Implementation ?
* Predictive process approach, Banerjee et al., 2008 (possible on SGLMMs ?)
  * Implementation: spBayes package
* INLA (SGLMMs ?)
  * Implementation: INLA package
* Hierarchical Nearest-Neighbor Gaussian Process Models for Large Geostatistical Datasets, Abhirup Datta et al, 2016 (SGLMMs ?)
  * Implementation: spNNGP package



### For areal data

* Projection based MCMC, Gaun et Hara, 2018 (possible on SGLMMs)
  * Implementation ?
* Dimension reduction and alleviation of confounding for spatial generalized linear mixed models, Hughes et al, 2013. (possible on SGLMMs)
  * Implementation: ngspatial





## Spatial Temporal Statistics: Large data





* Spatio-Temporal Statistics with R (Basis Expansion).
